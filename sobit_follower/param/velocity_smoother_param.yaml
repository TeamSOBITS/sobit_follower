# Configuration example
# Speed limit is about 10% above the physical limit
# Acceleration limit is low enough to avoid sway

# Mandatory parameters
speed_lim_v: 0.8
speed_lim_w: 5.4

accel_lim_v: 0.3 # maximum is actually 2.0, but we push it down to be smooth
accel_lim_w: 2.0

# Optional parameters
frequency: 20.0       # Frequency of the output velocity. Regardless of the frequency of the input data, the velocity smoother maintains this frequency and releases the data
decel_factor: 10.0    # Deceleration/acceleration ratio (can be increased for large moments of inertia)

# Robot velocity feedback type:
#  0 - none
#  1 - odometry
#  2 - end robot commands
robot_feedback: 2
